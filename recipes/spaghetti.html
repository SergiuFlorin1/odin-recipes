    <p>A humble packet of spaghetti can be transformed into something truly special. This long skinny pasta works when coated in emulsified carbonara sauce, tossed in a spicy tomato puttanesca, quickly mixed in a herby garlic oil – the options are too long to list. Spaghetti can also be elevated into something luxurious when served with shellfish, like prawns, clams or crab.</p>
    <p>The shape of spaghetti makes it the perfect pasta partner for a butter or oil-based sauce. Our top tip is to upgrade to bronze die cut spaghetti. This premium pasta is made using a technique that gives it a rough surface that better absorbs sauces, providing maximum flavour in every bite.</p>
    <p>Another piece of advice that will improve your pasta-eating experience is to reserve a cup of the salty, starchy pasta water after cooking. In Italy, pasta and sauce are combined in the pan before serving, and adding this precious cooking liquor helps the whole dish come together by adding body, flavour and general oomph.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Spaghetti puttanesca</strong></p>
    <p>The ultimate storecupboard supper. This saline hit of anchovy, olives and capers is tempered by sweet tomatoes and the heat of chilli flakes. A major contender for the mix-in-the-pan technique, use reserved pasta water to toss until glossy and serve direct in the pan with tongs for scooping</p>
    
    <p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a non-stick pan over a medium-low heat. Add the onion along with a generous pinch of salt and fry for 10 mins, or until soft. Add the garlic and chilli, if using, and cook for a further minute.</li>
        <li>Stir the tomatoes, anchovies, olives and capers into the onion, bring to a gentle simmer and cook, uncovered, for 15 mins. Season to taste.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Cook the spaghetti following pack instructions, then drain and toss with the sauce and parsley.</li>
