<p><strong>The first step</strong> is making the pizza dough which is then rolled out into a round and topped with four different kinds of cheese. Besides mozzarella, the three remaining types of cheese are a matter of personal preference. However, Parmigiano-Reggiano, provolone, and Fontina cheese are most commonly used. Alternatively, quattro formaggi may also include tomatoes, especially in northern Italy where they also like to add Gorgonzola to the topping.</p>
